# Learning Git and GitHub


## Introduction
This short course introduces GitHub. We intend to take you through from creating a GitHub account to collaborating using Git and GitHub. We will use resources that the lovely Git community has prepared and made available under the CC-BY license.

If you are using this curriculum to learn Git, we recommend you go through the materials sequentially. Nevertheless, if you have some experience, feel free to skip to the content of interest.

## Setting Up
For BOSS Workshops, you already have access to the HPC. If you need to set up the Git command line:
-follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/). 
- Additional instructions for setting up on a windows machine found [here](https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/using-git-and-github-on-windows).
